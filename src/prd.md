- **Floating Elements**: `glass-floating` with subtle levitation animation and depth shadows
- **Intense Dialogs**: `glass-panel-intense` with maximum blur and enhanced electric borders

### Color Strategy

#### Color Scheme Type
**Monochromatic Dark with Red Accents** - Deep blacks and grays as the foundation with carefully placed red laser accents for interaction and emphasis.

#### Primary Colors
- **Background**: `oklch(0.04 0 0)` - Ultra-deep black for maximum contrast
- **Foreground**: `oklch(0.92 0.02 0)` - Crisp white for text readability
